Since September 2018, Matthias Munz is working as bioinformatics scientist (Postdoc) at the group for Medical Systems Biology, University of Lübeck, led by Prof. Hauke Busch. He collaborates with Prof. Jeanette Erdmann, director of the Institute for Cardiogenetics at the same university. His research encompasses the detection of correlations to illuminate (epi)genetic causalities and pathomechanisms of common and rare diseases by analyzing all kinds of high-throughput (aka OMICs) data. In doing so, he complements available in-silico methods by own algorithms and data integration approaches ([Genehopper][genehopper], [Qtlizer][qtlizer] [[R/Bioconductor]][r-bioc], Polygenic Risk [ZEIT article][zeit-article]) .

<br/>
After his studies in Bioinformatics (BSc) at the University of Tübingen and Business Informatics (MSc) at the University of Braunschweig, he pursued his dissertation ([Link][dissertation-link]) as part of a scientific collaboration between Prof. Arne Schäfer of the Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Sciences at the Charité – University of Berlin and Prof. Jeanette Erdmann to identify novel risk loci for aggressive and chronic periodontitis. In 2019, he received his doctoral degree (Dr. rer. nat.) from the Free University of Berlin.

<br/>
Dr. Munz is Young DZHK member and associated member of the excellence cluster "Precision Medicine in Chronic Inflammation" (PMI). In 2019, he received the "DG PARO meridol - Basic Research" award from the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Parodontologie for his contributions on the genetics of periodontitis.
